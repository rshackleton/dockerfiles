# Scratch
A Docker Scratch Image w/ Timezones, HTTPS Certificates &amp; A Non Root User.

# Why?
I made this to give me a quick starting point for new Docker images, that are secure (non-root user) and can talk to HTTPS sites (https certificate) and know what the time is (timezones). It saves me having to add these lines to all my Dockerfiles.
